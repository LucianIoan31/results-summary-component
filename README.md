- Grid
- relative units
- linear-gradient background
- media queries
- data atributes selector

### What I learned

[data-spacing] - A new thing for me and it is very usefull
[@font-face] - a new way for me to use a text font
[custom-properties] - practiced custom properties
I think I found a way of code reseting from now one
I have understand that is better to style some elements inside a media query in order to get it as you want for the larger screens. Until now I was styling the elements for the larger screens and then using a media query so they can look 'default' on little screens. Lol, what was I doing? -_-

### Continued development

I struggled a lot in finding the best sizes of the containers, padding, margin and fonts. Using percentages is difficult at the moment. I got a lot of frustration when on a regular window it was looking ok, but maximizing the browser's window was making me design look ugly in different ways: or too large, or too stretched or the main container broken. This is something I need to learn. 

### Useful resources
